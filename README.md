Amazon Braket is a fully managed service that helps researchers and developers get started with quantum computing. 
It provides a development environment to explore and design quantum algorithms, test them on simulated quantum computers, and run them on different types of quantum hardware.

Use Cases:

    Optimization Problems:
        Supply Chain Optimization: Design quantum algorithms to find the optimal route or distribution method, which can minimize costs.
        Portfolio Optimization: In finance, use quantum computing to find the optimal portfolio distribution, considering various constraints.

    Machine Learning:
        Training Complex Models: Utilize quantum computing to train complex machine learning models more efficiently.
        Feature Selection: Quantum computing can be used for feature selection in high-dimensional data spaces.

    Material Science:
        Molecule Simulation: Understand and simulate molecule interactions at an unprecedented scale, which can lead to discoveries in new materials or drugs.

    Cryptography:
        Post-quantum Cryptography: Developing cryptographic algorithms that are secure against potential quantum attacks.

This repo contains working scripts I used for experiments on Amazon Braket.
